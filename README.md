A simple mutation script
==========================
This is a simple python script for performing mutation testing. It can generate mutants for C programs.

Usage
------------
python mutate.py <file-to-mutate.c> [output-mutant-file-name.c]

* Works better if comments are removed (decomment tool or gcc) and code is indented (indent tool)
